# To Do's

To avoid confusing Claude Code by asking it to complete orthogonal tasks in a single plan, keeping a short To Do list here:
- Refactor and clean up finished codebase:
  - Improve directory/file structure
  - Split out large files based on groupings of behavior
  - Revisit function names & general readability
  - Remove dead code / files (jquery.min.js, test screenshots)
