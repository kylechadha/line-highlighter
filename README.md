# Line Highlighter Chrome Extension

This extension creates a full width yellow line wherever you click. There's also a blinking cursor so you can follow along while you read.

### Controls
   `f` / `v` : move the line up / down 1px  
   `g` / `b` : move the line up / down 20px  
   `j` / `n` : increase / decrease the height of the line  
   `i` / `o` : move the cursor to the left / right  
   `c` : hide / show the cursor  

Thanks for checking out my extension! If you have any questions don't hesitate to leave a comment or tweet at @kylechadha.
